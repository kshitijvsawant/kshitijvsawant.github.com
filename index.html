<p>At Sahaj, we strive to build high-quality software that has strong aesthetics (is readable and maintainable), has extensive safety nets to safeguard quality, handles errors gracefully and works as expected, without breaking down, with varying input. 
We are looking for people who can write code that has flexibility built-in, by adhering to the principles of clean coding and Object-Oriented Development, and have the ability to deal with the real-life constraints/trade-offs while designing a system. 
It is important to note that we are not looking for a GUI and we are not assessing you on the capabilities around code required to do the I/O. The focus is on the overall design. So, while building a solution, it would be nicer if the input to the code is provided either via unit tests or a file. Using the command line (for input/output) can be tedious and difficult to test, so it is best avoided.
